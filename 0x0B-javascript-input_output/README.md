## File System Operations

The following files demonstrate Node.js file system operations:

- `0-read_file.js` - Reading files synchronously
- `1-write_file.js` - Writing files synchronously
- `2-append_write.js` - Appending content to files
- `100-append_after.js` - Inserting content after specific lines in a file
- `101-stats.js` - Logging file statistics

These examples use Node.js's built-in `fs` module to perform synchronous file operations, which are appropriate for small files or simple scripts.

## JSON Handling

These files demonstrate how to work with JSON data:

- `3-to_json_string.js` - Converting JavaScript objects to JSON strings
- `4-from_json_string.js` - Parsing JSON strings to JavaScript objects
- `5-save_to_json_file.js` - Saving objects to JSON files
- `6-load_from_json_file.js` - Loading objects from JSON files
- `7-add_item.js` - Adding items to JSON arrays in files
- `8-class_to_json.js` - Serializing class instances to JSON

These examples show the standard way to work with JSON data in JavaScript, including conversion between formats and persistent storage.

## Object-Oriented Programming

The student-related files demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts:

- `9-student.js` - Basic Student class implementation
- `10-student.js` - Student class with filtering capabilities (extends 9-student)
- `11-student.js` - Student class with reload functionality (extends 9-student)

These examples demonstrate core OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Algorithms

- `12-pascal_triangle.js` - Generating Pascal's Triangle

This example demonstrates algorithm design and implementation using nested loops.
