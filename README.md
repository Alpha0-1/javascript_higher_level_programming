## JavaScript Higher Level Programming

Welcome to the **JavaScript Higher Level Programming** repository!  
This is a curated learning journey designed to master JavaScript from intermediate to advanced concepts through hands-on practice, real-world examples, and progressive challenges.

## Overview

This repository is inspired by the structured curriculum style of Holberton School. Each folder represents a specific topic in JavaScript programming, moving from foundational logic to advanced features of the language.

Whether you're revising concepts, preparing for interviews, or building real-world skills, this repo serves as a valuable learning and reference guide.
